Multi-threaded element queue project (C++/Cmake)
================================================

1. Develop a class from scratch to queue a finite number of primitive
   types (e.g., int). This class will be used for multi-threaded
   communication as follows:

   - Reading thread pops elements while Writing thread pushes elements.
   - Two popping methods shall be available. If queue is empty, one of them
     shall block indefinitely, while the other one should throw an exception
     after a given timeout if no element is pushed meanwhile.
   - If queue is full, pushing a new element shall drop the oldest element
     in-queue before storing a new one.
   - To support different types, a template class shall be implemented.
   - Dynamic memory allocation shall be used to store queue elements (no
     std library for storing elements). Race conditions shall be avoided.
   - Code shall be document. Preferably using Doxygen style.
   - Performance issues are optionally addressed.
   - The class interface should look like this:

     class Queue<T> {
       Queue(int size) {...}
       void Push(T element) {...}
       T Pop() {...}
       T PopWithTimeout(int milliseconds) {...}
       int Count() {...} // Amount of elements stored now
       int Size() {...} // Max number of elements
     }

As an example implement the following in main():

Writing Thread step | Queue (after step) | Reading Thread step
--------------------------------------------------------------
New Queue<int>(2)   |                    |
Push(1)             |                  1 |
                    |                    | Pop() -> 1
Push(2)             |                  2 |
Push(3)             |                2,3 | 
Push(4) # 2 dropped |                3,4 | 
                    |                  4 | Pop() -> 3
                    |                    | Pop() -> 4
                    |                    | Pop() // blocks
Push(5)             |                  5 | 
                    |                    | -> 5 // released

2. Develop unit tests for the Queue class with support of a framework (e.g.
   cppunit, gtest, catch).
3. Develop a CMake configuration file to ease the build process (inc. tests).
4. Share your code at your Gitthub or Bitbucket account and send us the link.
